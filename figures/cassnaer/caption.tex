  Summary data from 20 experiments, plotting for each experiment the effect of STDP 1 OCT versus STDP alone (blue dots) and plotting control data, with and without OCT, for 13 of 20 experiments (black circles). Changes due to STDP 1 OCT differ significantly from control 1 OCT (P , 0.003, t-test). Changes due to OCT in control not significantly different from zero (P . 0.84, t-test; see also Supplementary Fig. 7). f, Comparison between change due to STDP 1 OCT and change due to STDP alone, each plotted as a function of dt. Changes due to STDP 1 OCT differ significantly from zero (relative to before STDP: P , 0.0001; relative to STDP only:
P , 0.0002, t-test; see also Supplementary Fig. 7).
