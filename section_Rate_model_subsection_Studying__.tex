Physiologically, $\alpha'\beta'$ KCs are slightly more responsive to odors and are the only KCs which are spontaneously active (albeit at only around 0.1 Hz) \cite{18094099}.

In memory tasks, one study found that neurotransmission from $\alpha'\beta'$ KCs is required for acquisition and consolidation of odor memory, but not for retrieval, while $\alpha\beta$ KCs are required only for retrieval \cite{17196534}
